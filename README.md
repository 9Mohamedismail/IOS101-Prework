## App I would like to make..
I would like to make a task to-do app. I am someone who loves to be organized and lives on my to-do list apps. However, I feel like I have not found the best to-do list apps yet. I constantly switch between different ones and want a singler app with everything I love - and best part? It's free!
### Features...
1. Create different folders or sections for each task. EX: "Home, Work, School"
2. New tasks get added to calendar (FREE. Not a premium feature)
3. Sort tasks by due dates or importance (You can set importance for each one)
4. Add pictures to your tasks. 
5. Built in timer for productivity.
